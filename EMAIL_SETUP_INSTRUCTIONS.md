# Email Setup Instructions for Portfolio Contact Form

Your portfolio now has a fully functional contact form that will send emails directly to your inbox using nodemailer! ðŸŽ‰

## Quick Setup Guide

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Email Settings

You need to set up Gmail App Password (NOT your regular Gmail password):

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Google Account:
   - Go to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
   - Enable 2-Step Verification if not already enabled

2. **Generate App Password**:
   - Go to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
   - Click on "App passwords" (you'll need 2FA enabled first)
   - Select "Mail" as the app
   - Copy the generated 16-character password

3. **Update .env file**:
   - Open the `.env` file in your project
   - Replace `your-app-password-here` with the 16-character app password
   - Your email is already set to `shrutijayaswal671@gmail.com`

### 3. Start the Server
```bash
npm start
```

Or for development with auto-restart:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Test Your Contact Form
- Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`
- Fill out the contact form
- Submit it and check your email!
